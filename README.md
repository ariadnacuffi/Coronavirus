COVID-19 analysis about it's magnitude, spread across the globe, predictions, correlated features and it's impact on the economy 

COVID-19 is spreading across the globe, and all of us are suffering the consequences. This project is focused on analysing the pandemia in different ways. 

Started by examining what is the magnitude of the disease, by comparing it with every other epidemic of this century. 

Continued by studying how the pandemia spread during the time and across the globe, and trying to understand how the different countries are dealing with it.  

Then, did a demographic analysis by checking if there is a gender or a range of  age with more susceptibility than the others.

Furthermore, I wanted to check if temperature and humidity had any effect on the proliferation of the disease. 

Finally, I wanted to check how the COVID-19 is affecting the global stock markets, by sector.
